# (Re)discovering the ssh tips for Ansible
## (CentOS.org infra use case)
### Fabian Arrotin
#### arrfab@centos.org, @arrfab

???
These are some notes presented in presenter mode and not on screen

---
class: center, middle

# /whois arrfab 

---

# Disclaimer

### Depending on your SysAdmin experience, we'll (re)discover basic things ...

--

#### and then we'll add tips ....

---
# Agenda

* SSH intro
* Authentication[s]
 * Hosts
 * Clients
* Accessing hosts behind other hosts (bastion/jump hosts)
* Speeding up sshd 
  * ssh clients
  * Ansible

---
# SSH
* Secure Shell
* Crypto (PKI)
* Secure channel (client-server)

???
Can be used for plenty of things (shell, tunnel, autossh, vpn, sshuttle)

---
## SSH usage for something else than shell
 * Shell multiplexers
  * pssh
  * mussh
  * clusterssh (cssh)
 * TCP/IP tunnels for ports
  * rsync /localdir/ \
    remoteuser@remotehost:/remotedir/
  * ssh -L 8000:remote:80
  * autossh (keep ports opened for you)
  * sshuttle : _Transparent Proxy VPN_ 

???
sshuttle lets you connect to remote network/transparently tunnel remote subnet from your your local node
---
## SSHD authentication (reminder)
 * Host itself
  * /etc/ssh/ssh__host_{rsa,ecdsa,ed25519}_key (private)
  * /etc/ssh/ssh__host_{rsa,ecdsa,ed25519}_key.pub (public)
--

 * Client[s]
  * Password 
  * PKI (ssh, gpg, x509)
  * GSSAPI (Kerberos, NTLM)

---

## First connection on CentOS 6 
####(openssh-5.3p1-124.el6_10.x86_64)
```bash
ssh centos@client6.lon1.centos.org
The authenticity of host 'client6.lon1.centos.org (172.29.33.45)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:Hu7rwmk/Ik2n9PkwC780IBn1FkU5g9pcTal6hAEZJdI.
RSA key fingerprint is MD5:29:63:c6:76:92:ad:5c:a9:8e:84:b5:fa:59:93:b4:79.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
```
---
## First connection on CentOS 7 
####(openssh-7.4p1-16.el7.x86_64)
```bash
ssh centos@client7.lon1.centos.org
The authenticity of host 'client7.lon1.centos.org (172.29.33.43)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:SgNEoy8SJ/ibA3Mkb3e9sW2q1w41XwCgjI+j3t0JT8E.
ECDSA key fingerprint is MD5:ec:c2:2a:84:58:01:49:b1:56:97:a5:82:87:0d:5b:e1.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?

```

???
Keep that RSA vs ECDSA diff in mind for later (SSH cert for hosts)

---
## Bypassing checks (BAD !!!!!)
( /etc/ssh/ssh_config or ~/.ssh/config)
```ini
Host *
 StrictHostKeyChecking no
```

---
## Bypassing host checks (BAD !!!!)
#### Ansible version
(/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg or .ansible.cfg , etc)
```ini
[defaults]
host_key_checking = False

```

---
# How to validate centrally ?
* Distribute ssh known-hosts file ? (can be large)

--
* SSHFP dns records ?

--
* CA ?


---
### SSH / DNS validation (SSHFP records)
Once you have verified, you can generate SSHFP records easily : 
```bash
ssh-keygen -r git.centos.org
git.centos.org IN SSHFP 1 1 9ec70a9a1b6c958235d33df0c60c7c6077a63d2a
git.centos.org IN SSHFP 1 2 d4eaf3dc8093c1cdab783c635af1b609dc8c0fb8607dd35bb2325d7755c55249
git.centos.org IN SSHFP 3 1 1124569ae79bf90b4fef233e31d6f94156a169e3
git.centos.org IN SSHFP 3 2 876dc95cafc568348b16f6b0c805f1712d99f9fb9895762be52577834793d66a
git.centos.org IN SSHFP 4 1 09884343d3e31f7ebf55d4c51d7b043846860428
git.centos.org IN SSHFP 4 2 1fcee5a2fde5525bb8bc93a30d74c12fbe42eef03041e1a31293ff31b5eb9b68
```
And push that in your DNS zone file
"fqdn, IN, SSHFP, Algorithm (integer), Fingerprint type (integer), Fingerprint (in hex)" 

???
Algorithm

1 - RSA
2 - DSA
3 - ECDSA
4 - Ed25519
Fingerprint type
Two fingerprint types are defined in SSHFP as of 2012. Each fingerprint type is represented by an integer. These are:

1 - SHA-1
2 - SHA-256


---
### SSH / DNS validation (SSHFP)
#### Client side 
Add this to your ~/.ssh/config (or /etc/ssh/ssh_config) :
```ini
VerifyHostKeyDNS yes 
```
	
---
# SSHD certificates for hosts
## HTTPS/TLS analogy
* Server generates key/pub
* CSR signed by CA
* Client (trusting CA) access https server
* Presents pub certs, signed by CA
* Ack

---
## (Open)SSH CA setup ?

--

### Yes we can ! 

---
## SSH Certificate Authority
Like "usual" : create a key:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/ca_host_key
tree ~/.ssh/
/home/user/.ssh/
├── ca_host_key
└── ca_host_key.pub

```
--
Search for 'CERTIFICATES' in _man ssh-keygen_


---
## SSH CA / sshd side
Now we just need to "sign" (on the CA host)  the .pub sshd host key files
```bash
ssh-keygen -s {{ ssh_ca_host_key }} \
  -I {{ inventory_hostname }} \
  -h \
  -Z {{ inventory_hostname }} ssh_host_rsa_key.pub
```
That will produce a -cert.pub file (like ssh_host_rsa_key-cert.pub), that you just need to copy to new server under /etc/ssh/

---
## SSH CA / sshd side
And now you have to inform sshd that you can present a host certificate, signed by CA, in /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```bash
# Presenting ssh host pub cert signed by CA host
# Defaulting to RSA for now due to incompatibility with older openssh clients , still on el6
HostCertificate /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key-cert.pub
```
and reload
```bash
 systemctl restart sshd
```

---
## SSH CA / Client side
Declare that you trust your CA (part of the .pub key you created initially in step 1) in either:
 * ~/.ssh/known_hosts (user)
 * /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts (system-wide)

Example for CentOS.org nodes:
```bash
@cert-authority *.centos.org ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDXmhva/yVOS6y/sR1Pjd+Gflzkl7azfl3ZIhex5kSHilUjT3DSjfXK0TgSHT93BCKs1/mT84ZKv6s+Ulfc3kC9aykJQnkWJ6I6CjIgfIM547VT2Egx5fKJZ/7yRedYf6HoVPZSAW5WYKZ0fq/DDoAFUuZJkkp3QEzh6TUiXif9qjCu3liXNgkS2uVIWc7+1QTLRxqU3/MCD1YxuOL8ShyMSHlGJTRMMTYq6aAFmlQ/FsA8deb9HeR3PaAZx7Q7jqmiJD5cx9XtrmgM4CCZNFxP9i0s+L7yDKzFQ1ecm1/vzouOsAVcSh7MiAexuBLgbUdhmBDGVEJYQDNENKOdaoiP
```

---
## SSH CA example
ssh git.centos.org -v
```bash
...
debug1: Server host certificate: ssh-rsa-cert-v01@openssh.com SHA256:nOTFfaeWJjilN5uFPeOSyscBABG2zLe3w/W00dBqE64, serial 0 ID "git1.centos.org" CA ssh-rsa SHA256:wLEN4HjckDqT7HPXzWRZ7yYQSDOj0JOh+fOt9IQfMwE valid forever
debug1: Host 'git.centos.org' is known and matches the RSA-CERT host certificate.
debug1: Found CA key in /home/centos/.ssh/known_hosts:1
...
```

???
Demo on dev-loadays.lon1.centos.org
ssh -v git.centos.org
then known_hosts and see the diff

* https://github.com/centos/ansible-role-sshd
* https://github.com/centos/ansible-role-ansible-host

---
## Accessing nodes directly behind other "bastion" hosts
#### Client can reach bastion host , and bastion can reach *.internal.corp.dev , but Client can't directly reach internal
~/.ssh/config to the Rescue
```bash
Host bastion
 Hostname bastion.pub.corp.dev
 ProxyCommand none
 
Host *.internal.corp.dev
 ProxyCommand ssh bastion -W %h:p%
```
---
## Accessing nodes through bastion hosts - Ansible version
### Using group and group_vars
Let's create a "proxied" file in our inventory and have it populated with some nodes/groups
```ini
[proxied-dc1]
node1
node2
[proxied-dc2]
node3
node4
```
---
## Now let's use ssh variables to say to use ProxyCommand
```bash
cat group_vars/proxied-dc1
ansible_ssh_common_args: '-o ProxyCommand="ssh -W %h:%p -q user@bastion.dc1.domain.com"'
```

---
## Ansible / Mitogen
Same concept but use **mitogen_via**
#### More on Mitogen later ...

---
### SSH ControlMaster
#### in a need to "speed up" connections ? you can let those "open"
```bash
Host * 
 GSSAPIAuthentication no
 ForwardAgent yes
 ControlMaster auto
 ControlPath /tmp/ssh_mux_%h_%p_%r
 ControlPersist 120m
```

--
Can also be configured in ansible.cfg (through ssh_args) ...
##### Idea : job that collects/cache facts and keep connections ....

---
### Ansible speed-up 
What's consuming a *lot* of time for nothing during playbook execution ?

--

### Facts gathering ! 

--
from our ansible.cfg (per inventory)
```ini
# Adding some interesting stats
callback_whitelist = profile_tasks, timer
# Switch to smart so also using cached facts
gathering = smart
fact_caching = jsonfile
fact_caching_connection = .ansible_cache

```

---
### Mitogen (but in next talks ....) :-)

```ini
{% if item.use_mitogen %}
strategy_plugins = {{ item.base_path }}/mitogen/ansible_mitogen/plugins/strategy
strategy = mitogen_linear
{% else %}
strategy = linear
{% endif %}

```
